# E-commerce-Online-Platform
 Developed a fully functional e-commerce platform that enables users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases. The project was built using React for the front end and Node.js with Express.js for the back end, connected to a MySQL database for data management.

 How to View the Output

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install Dependencies:

cd client  
npm install  # if using Create React App  
In the server directory:

cd server  
npm install  
Setting Up the Database:

Open your MySQL client and run the SQL statements provided to create the database and table.
Insert some sample data into the products table for testing.
Start the Server:

cd server  
node server.js  
Start the React Front End:

cd client  
npm start  
View in Browser:

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to view the e-commerce platform in action.

Summary of server.js
The server.js file serves as the central entry point for the E-commerce Online Platform application. It is responsible for setting up the server, configuring middleware, and defining routes for handling client requests. Hereâ€™s an overview of its key functionalities:

Express Framework Setup: The file initializes an Express application, which is used for creating a robust web server that can handle various HTTP requests.

Middleware Configuration: Various middleware functions are incorporated to enhance request handling. This includes but is not limited to:

Body Parsing: Using middleware like body-parser to handle JSON and URL-encoded request bodies.
CORS: Setting up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from different domains.
Database Connection: The server.js file often includes code to connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB). It handles connection errors and confirms successful connection to ensure the application can store and retrieve data.

Route Definitions: Key routes for functionalities such as user authentication, product listings, shopping cart management, and order processing are defined. These routes link to separate route handler modules for better organization.

Environment Variables: Configuration settings, including the server port and database connection strings, are often loaded from environment variables to protect sensitive information and make it easier to manage different environments (development, production).

Error Handling: The server includes middleware for error handling to catch and respond to errors gracefully, providing appropriate status codes and messages to clients.

Server Listening: Finally, the server is set to listen for incoming requests on a specified port, allowing the application to start accepting connections.

Usage
To run the server, execute the following command in the root directory of the project:

node server.js  
Ensure that all environment variables are set, and dependencies are installed before starting the server.
